# EpiMethEx Analysis

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism of genomic regulation involved in the
maintenance of homeostatic balance. Dysregulation of DNA methylation status is 
one of the driver alterations occurring in neoplastic transformation and cancer 
progression. The identification of methylation hotspot associated to gene 
dysregulation may contribute to discover new prognostic and diagnostic 
biomarker, as well as, new therapeutic target.

We present EpiMethEx (Epigenetic Methylation and Expression), a R package to 
perform a large-scale integrated analysis by cyclic correlation analyses 
between methylation and gene expression data. For each gene, samples are 
segmented according to the expression levels to select genes that are 
differentially expressed. This stratification allows to identify CG 
methylation probesets modulated among gene-stratified samples. 
Subsequently, the methylation probesets are clustered by their relative 
position in gene sequence to identify wide genomic methylation events 
statically related to genetic modulation. The simulation study showed that 
the global methylation analysis was in agreement with scientific literature. 
In particular, this analysis revealed a negative association between promoter
hypomethylation and overexpression in a wide number of genes. Less frequently, 
this overexpression was sustained by intragenic hypermethylation events.
